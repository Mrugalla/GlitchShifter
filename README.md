# PitchGlitcher
a pitch shifter with a feedback parameter

How to download PitchGlitcher VST3:
1. Click on the Release-Page (to the right)
2. Download the zip-File. It's in there.

Known issues:
- on some computers it doesn't run in Studio One (it does on mine, so idk..)
- saving new default values with the context menu of the parameters doesn't entirely work (yet)
   > most DAWs provide a feature for that too tho!
